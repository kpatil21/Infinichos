<h1>About.</h1>
<p>At 22, I began my self-development journey toward becoming a man. It all started in 2018 when I first understood what it truly means to be a man — a fully functioning one. That thought stayed with me, and by 2019, I knew the next step: to put myself into a phase I called “Vanvas” — a period where the boyishness within would be destroyed, and the process of a man's rebirth would begin. </p>
<p>I decided to leave my hometown, take charge of my shelter, food, and basic needs — to be independent and accountable. But what I didn't realize then is that killing the boy within isn't a simple task. In ancient times, our ancestors would send boys into the forest or on a hunt to test their strength, courage, and discipline. Only then would they be honored as men. In today’s world, that process is missing — and that’s why we see so many grown-up boys around us.</p>
<p>Looking back, I didn’t know that simply planning to “kill the boy” wouldn’t be enough. That’s where God came in — with His own karmic agenda. What followed from late 2019 to 2024 was isolation like never before. I was forced to face myself. I had to dig deep into my inner layers — to the point where I even forgot what I looked like.</p>
<p>Today, as I share this, I feel grateful for everything I went through — because it helped me give birth to the Man within. I recognize that there’s a shortage of healthy masculinity in the world today. But I also believe we need both — Man and Woman — to build a balanced and thriving generation.</p>
<p>Now, I hope to serve others through the wisdom and experience I’ve gained. My mission is to help restore equilibrium within humanity. I’m war-ready — still fighting my own battles, learning every day — and I’ll continue to, so I never lose that spark and excitement for life.</p>
<p>Life is not just about survival and reproduction — though they are primary instincts. But we also have the freedom to explore our full potential — as lovers, kings and queens, creators, healers. We are the same, yet beautifully different.</p>
<p>This is simply a path I’ve discovered — one that challenges outdated, blind beliefs about life and dreams — and invites us all to rediscover what it means to live with purpose.</p>
